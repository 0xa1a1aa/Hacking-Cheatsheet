# Tip #1

***Enumerate, enumerate, enumerate!!!***
Information is king!

# Tip #2

Follow a **breadth-first-search** approach:
Explore the surface and easy wins before diving deeper into a single subject. It might just lead down a rabbit hole!

# Tip #3

If an exploit fails, try 2 more others! If they fail too, it might not be the right path!

# Tip #4

If something looks out-of-place, its probably there for a reason.
